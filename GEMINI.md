# Project Context: TIL (Today I Learned)

## 1. Project Overview
This repository serves as a personal knowledge base for tracking daily learning (TIL - Today I Learned). It is organized by technical topics, focusing on Computer Science fundamentals and software engineering practices.

**Project Type:** Non-Code Project (Documentation/Knowledge Base)

## 2. Directory Structure & Contents
The repository is categorized into top-level directories representing major study areas:

*   **AI/**: LLM (Large Language Models), LangChain, LangGraph, and other Artificial Intelligence related technologies and experiments.
*   **Algorithm/**: Solutions to algorithmic problems and theoretical concepts.
*   **DevOps/**: Documentation related to Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure.
*   **Language/**: Notes on programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript), syntax nuances, and best practices.
*   **Network/**: Network protocols, theory, and practical networking concepts.
*   **OS/**: Operating System concepts, kernel internals, and system management.
*   **Web/**: Frontend and Backend web technologies, frameworks, and architecture.

## 3. Usage & Conventions
This repository is primarily used for documentation. Future interactions should adhere to the following established conventions:

*   **File Format:** Content is predominantly written in Markdown (`.md`).
*   **Location:** New notes must be placed in the most relevant topic directory.
*   **Naming Convention:** Filenames should be descriptive and kebab-case (e.g., `docker-compose-basics.md`) as per `README.md` instructions.
*   **Indexing:** The root `README.md` should be maintained as an index, containing hyperlinks to each note along with a brief one-line summary.
*   **Language:** While the structure is English-friendly, the content language (based on `README.md`) appears to be Korean.

## 4. Operational Notes
*   **Current State:** As of the initial analysis, some directories (e.g., `Algorithm`, `Language`) appear to be empty. This suggests the repository is in an early stage or under active migration.
*   **Code Snippets:** While primarily documentation, folders like `Algorithm` or `Web` may contain isolated code files (`.py`, `.java`, `.js`) in the future to demonstrate concepts.
